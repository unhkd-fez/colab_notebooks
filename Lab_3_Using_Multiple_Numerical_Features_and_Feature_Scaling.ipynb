The first task is to train a model to predict `city-mpg` from `highway-mpg` and `price` without using any feature processing.  Remember what you learned in the last lab about how to find a good learning rate and numer of steps to train."

You will need to make sure that your output from `linear_scale` is a real number (versus an integer). Be sure to test your function on some examples.  For example if the input series originally had values going from 10 to 20, then after applying linear scale 10 should map to 0, 11 should map to 1, 12 should map to 2, ... and so on with 20 mapping to 1."
